  * ## Project Description
    
    For this project, the player wants to purchase a heart container. In his pocket, he has (4) different types of rupees, but has no idea how much each rupees is worth to the mystery salesperson. This strange salesperson is very fickle and does not like anything extra leftover, so you must carefully match the value of the heart container.. or else he will change his mind and demand a new price for the heart container!
  
  * ## Technologies Used

    I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project.

    For HTML, I created &lt;p&gt; tags with the IDs to be dynamically filed in later. These will be stats, such as the price of the heart container, the number of rupees value you gave to the salesperson so far, how many times you have won in this game, and how many times you've lost in this game.

    For CSS, I set the background-color as bisque and added some margin and adjusted alignment.

    For JavaScript, I started by resetting the game and randomly generating the price of the heart container and the value of each rupees. Then, when the player clicks a rupee, the randomly generated rupee amount with get added to the counter until the player either matches the price or passes the price. If the player wins, the win counter goes up; loses, loss counter. Then the reset function runs to start all over.
